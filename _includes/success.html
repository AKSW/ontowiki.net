                <p class="right">In the amsl.technology project an Electronic Resource Management System is developed based on OntoWiki.
                amsl.technology is targeted to support libraries and other players in the library domain to manage not only physical resources, such as books, journals, CDs/DVDs,
                but also electronic resources (e.g. e-journals, e-books or databases).</p>

                <p class="right">The projects SÃ¤chsisches Pfarrerbuch (engl. Saxonian pastors book) and Catalogus Profesorum Lipsiensium (CPL) are projects for prosopographical knowledge bases.
                The Pfarrerbuch is aiming to catalog all pastors serving in the Lutheran Church in Saxony since the reformation in 1517.
                The CPL collects all professors who have taught at Leipzig University from its foundation in 1409 to the presence. Currently it comprises more than 14, 000 entities.
                In both systems OntoWiki is used as data curation and exploration platform especially for data scientists and domain experts in the respective historical domain.</p>

                <p class="left">The website of our research group 9 (AKSW) is backed by an OntoWiki with an extension for publishing websites based on templates and data from a triple store.
                    This sophisticated extension is called the site extension 7 and it extends OntoWiki towards a CMS.
                    Since the AKSW research group has become quite large recently (the website currently includes more than 50 team members and a large number of different projects) a CMS is indispensable.</p>
