                    <p>In the amsl.technology project an Electronic Resource Management System is developed based on OntoWiki.
                    amsl.technology is targeted to support libraries and other players in the library domain to manage not only physical resources, such as books, journals, CDs/DVDs,
                    but also electronic resources (e.g. e-journals, e-books or databases).</p>

                    The Pfarrerbuch is aiming to catalog all pastors serving in the Lutheran Church in Saxony since the reformation in 1517.</p>

                    <p class="left">The website of our research group 9 (AKSW) is backed by an OntoWiki with an extension for publishing websites based on templates and data from a triple store.
                        This sophisticated extension is called the site extension 7 and it extends OntoWiki towards a CMS.
                        Since the AKSW research group has become quite large recently (the website currently includes more than 50 team members and a large number of different projects) a CMS is indispensable.</p>
